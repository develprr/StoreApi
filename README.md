# StoreApi
This is a demo API showcasing an ASP.NET based online web store API that uses MongoDB as its database to store items.

This project was implemented by combining and applying instructions provided by exactly these three tutorials:

* [TodoApi tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-8.0&amp;tabs=visual-studio-code)
* [Bookstore API with MongoDB tutorial](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mongo-app)
* [Swagger](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/web-api-help-pages-using-swagger?view=aspnetcore-8.0)

The API's name is just StoreApi, not BookApi, not PetshopApi,
nothing like that. Just boringly, plainly and simply "StoreApi".
