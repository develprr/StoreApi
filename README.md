# StoreApi

## Description

This is a demo API showcasing an ASP.NET based online web store API that uses MongoDB as its database to store items.
The API's name is just StoreApi, not BookStoreApi, not PetshopApi, nothing like that. Just boringly, plainly and simply "StoreApi".
This is because I don't have the slightest idea what I should sell in my store :)
