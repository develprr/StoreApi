# StoreApi
This is a demo API showcasing an ASP.NET based online web store API that uses MongoDB as its database to store items.

The API's name is just StoreApi, not BookApi, not PetshopApi,
noting like that. Just boringly, plainly and simply "StoreApi".

Because I don't know yet what I want to sell! :)
